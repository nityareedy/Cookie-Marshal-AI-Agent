# Cookie Marshal AI Agent

> **An autonomous browser extension that detects and rejects cookie consent banners using pattern recognition and Q-learning ‚Äî all locally, without compromising performance or privacy.**

---

## üöÄ Overview

Cookie Marshal is a browser-based AI agent built to automatically decline cookie banners across websites, prioritizing **speed**, **privacy**, and **practical AI** over heavy general-purpose models.

This project is a case study in applying **narrow AI** techniques for highly specialized tasks ‚Äî specifically, intelligently managing cookie consent prompts using a mix of pattern matching, DOM scanning, and reinforcement learning.

## üß† Key AI Features

### ‚úîÔ∏è Domain-Specific Intelligence

- **Q-Learning Agent**: Learns and adapts optimal rejection strategies over time.
- **Multi-Signal Detection**: CSS selector matching, keyword analysis, and DOM structure awareness.
- **Language-Aware Text Classification**: Recognizes reject/accept buttons in 8+ languages.
- **Complexity-Based Flow Control**: Chooses between rule-based and AI-based logic based on banner complexity.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Why Not LLMs?

| Criteria       | Cookie Marshal AI | LLM-based Solutions |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Processing     | Sub-200ms         | 1‚Äì5s (API latency)   |
| Privacy        | 100% local        | API calls, tracking  |
| Reliability    | Deterministic     | Variable             |
| Resources      | < 50MB            | GBs (local) / costly (API) |
| Offline Access | Yes               | No                   |

Cookie Marshal avoids LLMs intentionally ‚Äî not due to limitation, but to **optimize for speed, privacy, and task relevance**.

## üîß How It Works

### 1. **Detection Phase**

- Identifies cookie banners using:
  - 40+ CSS selectors
  - Text patterns in 8 languages
  - Framework-specific signatures (OneTrust, CookieBot, etc.)
  - Shadow DOM and iframe scanning
  - Delayed content tracking (AJAX)

### 2. **Analysis Phase**

- Evaluates banner complexity:
  - **Simple (0‚Äì30%)**: Rule-based logic
  - **Moderate (30‚Äì70%)**: Rule + AI with confidence comparison
  - **Advanced (70%+)**: AI-first with rule fallback

- Performs:
  - Contextual button classification
  - DOM structure scoring
  - Q-learning for feedback-based optimization

### 3. **Action Phase**

- Executes strategy based on structure:
  - One-click ‚ÄúReject All‚Äù
  - Navigates multi-step preferences
  - Automatically deselects non-essential cookies
  - Submits consent decisions

### 4. **Learning Phase**

- Stores successful patterns (locally)
- Updates Q-values based on outcomes
- Optimizes strategy selection for known domains

### 5. **Privacy & Security**

- No data transmission
- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking
- Functions offline, no API keys
- Secure permissions and sandboxed code

## üß™ Example Flow (Real Use)

1. Detects banner ‚Üí OneTrust style
2. Classifies as complex (75%)
3. Enters preference panel ‚Üí disables all optional cookies
4. Saves preferences
5. Learns pattern for future visits

Total time: ~2‚Äì4 seconds
